    "\n",
    "This script contains computational steps used to format existing output from a Tutuila Water Budget Model for use in the Tutuila-wide DIN loading model, which is documented in the report \"Island Wide Nutrient Modeling and Quantification of Coastal Freshwater Discharge for Tutuila, American Samoa\" as authored by Shuler Hydrologic LLC and delivered to the American Samoa Environmental Protection Agency. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that this script requires the Arcpy python module to run. This module requires that the user have a valid ESRI licence and is running this script in an environment where Arcpy is installed.  This script is optional to running the model, its output is contained in a single spreadsheet that is used by scrpt 2 of 2 as input. This spreadsheet has alreadt been generated using a cell size of 100 m and the 93 watershed boundaries used in the model. If the user wishes to modify calculation of water budget components for different boundaries, this script can be run and a different shapefile can be substituted for \"AG_OSDS_PIGS_NATURAL_ACTIVE_WS.shp\".\n",
